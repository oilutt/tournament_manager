# Tournament Manager

Tournament Manager is a championship manager that you can control/follow the championships of which you are the owner or participant and even just a spectator.

The first version of the app has the most common styles of championships, such as League, Cup and Tournament. Soon we will have more specific styles, such as the styles of e-sports championships.

Do not miss the opportunity to manage your championship in a practical and simple way, and the best, at no cost.
